Homework 2:
lx565 Le Xu


Assignment 1: 
I was able to get the api key and grab the Json file from MTA. The json file is rather difficult to read different layers, 
so I used Json file reader to help me look into different objects.
I asked help from a friend who is a student from Tandon, she taught me to google the use of sys.argv and build a function in homework 1.
I did 70% of this work purely by myself. 


Assignment 2:
I did this homework under the help of Franz and Chunqing, as well as their teammate Jianghao. They've already been worked on the third question
when i arrived to the library. I occassionly ask them question of my code, they helped me with the "N/A" in the for loop, also help me correctly 
identify the right Oncalls category. Throught out the whole learning process from them, I did not copy any of their codes, and tried my best
to write my own code. I think next time I will team up with them, because they are very patient and nice! 
I have to say i did around 50-60% of this work purely based on my knowledge of programming.

Assignment 3:
I learned to do this homework mainly by looking at Professor Bianco's class notes. I was able to access the dataset from the link.
I was not able to use environment variables to asscess the data, Jianghao and Yuxuan Han, they hinted me that the filename from datahub is
just a folder name, there are some sub-folders too. So after hours of struggling, I was able to access the data using env var. 
I did this homework 90% by myself.
